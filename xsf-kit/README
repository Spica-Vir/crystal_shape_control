cube2xsf converts CRYSTAL CUBE format (with periodic boundary information) into 3D periodic XSF data format.

xsfkit computes planar averaged data along the specified lattice vector, with surface normalized to 1 (Cross section area printed out). xsfkit also computes charge density difference. xsfkit is compatible with xsf files by cube2xsf and Quantum Espresso pw.x.

The default unit for 3D geometry is Angstrom. Unit of grid data is consistent with software output. For charge of CRYSTAL CUBE and Quantum Espresso, e/Bohr**-3. Geometry for plane averaged data is computed and reported in Bohr to be compatible with grid data.
